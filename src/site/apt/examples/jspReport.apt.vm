Analyzing JSP Code

  The PMD plugin analyzes Java by default. You can configure it to analyze Java Server Pages files instead as shown below.

  The example assumes that the JSP source code is stored in various subdirectories under the source directory
  <<<src/main/webapp>>> and enables all rules from the categories "Best Practices", "Codestyle",
  "Design", "Error Prone" and "Security".

 Note that you have to make sure that you configure <<<compileSourceRoots>>> and <<<includes>>>, so that
 PMD finds the JSP files.
 
 See {{{https://pmd.github.io/pmd-${pmdVersion}/pmd_rules_jsp.html}JSP Rule Index}} for a complete list
 of available rules.

 <<Note:>> Configuring <<<compileSourceRoots>>> only works with Maven 3.3.9 and later. For older versions,
 you'll need to use <build-helper-maven-plugin> with the <<<add-source>>> goal in order to add
 the additional source directories, so that PMD finds the JSP files.
