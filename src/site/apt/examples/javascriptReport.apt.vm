Analyzing JavaScript Code

 The PMD plugin analyzes Java by default. You can configure it to analyze JavaScript files instead as shown below.

 The example assumes that the JavaScript source code is stored in the subdirectory <<<src/main/javascript>>> and
 enables all rules from the "Best Practices", "Codestyle", and "Error Prone" categories.

 Note that you have to make sure that you configure <<<compileSourceRoots>>> and <<<includes>>>, so that
 PMD finds the JavaScript files.
 
 See {{{https://pmd.github.io/pmd-${pmdVersion}/pmd_rules_ecmascript.html}JavaScript Rule Index}} for the list
 of available rules.

 <<Note:>> Configuring <<<compileSourceRoots>>> only works with Maven 3.3.9 and later. For older versions,
 you'll need to use <build-helper-maven-plugin> with the <<<add-source>>> goal in order to add
 the additional source directories, so that PMD finds the JavaScript files.
