# available toolchains under linux:

# the jdk toolchain "11:oracle" is selected in pom.xml

# the file toolchains.xml will be created by selector.groovy
# - for linux, ${user.home}/.m2/toolchains.xml will be copied
# - for windows, a new file will be created using toolchains.windows.xml, see selector.groovy
